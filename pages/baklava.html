  <h1>Greek Baklava</h1>
  <img src="../img/baklava.jpeg">
  <p>A Greek favorite that makes everyone think you are a master chef and is sooo easy to make!! I taught a Greek friend
    how to make apple pie and she taught me this fabulous recipe. The phyllo dough for this recipe is found in the
    freezer section of most grocery stores. Add a little lemon zest to the sugar sauce, if desired.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 package phyllo dough</li>
    <li>1 pound chopped nuts</li>
    <li>1 cup butter</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9x13 inch pan.</li>
    <li>Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside. Unroll phyllo dough. Cut whole stack in half to fit pan. Cover
      phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter
      thoroughly. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered. Sprinkle 2 - 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two
      sheets of dough, butter, nuts, layering as you go. The top layer should be about 6 - 8 sheets deep.</li>
    <li>Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4
      long rows the make diagonal cuts. Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.</li>
    <li>Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. Simmer
      for about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove baklava from oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let cool. Serve in cupcake papers. This freezes
      well. Leave it uncovered as it gets soggy if it is wrapped up.</li>
  </ol>
